							<h2>How to Dress</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>Before the Loft, my idea of fashion was sports clothing. Sweatpants and sweatshirts. Now I know how to dress for the occassion.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Deliver Great Customer Service</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I was awful at selling my first day. I literally went in a circle of a customer asking me how the pants looked and me asking her if they fit her well. I later learned how clothes properly fit and could serve the customers better.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>A good listener is a good sales person</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>The more you listen to your customer the better you can sell to them. For me my designs are easier to sell to them if I listened to their needs.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Smile,<br/> Even When you have a bad day</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I had to smile constantly at work. That my face would hurt. It was good practice for dealing with customers.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Keep your personal integrity</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Trust your moral compass.</li>
								<li>speak up or try another tactic</li>
								<li> 2008 crisis happened, and credit cards</li>
								<li>Two credit card options</li>
							</ul>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Do Whatever the job requires</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I cleaned toilets, took out trash, and cleaned tracked poop off the floor</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>People will try to steal from you</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>Every once in awhile a person would come in and try to steal from the store. The regulation was we could try to stop them in the store by being extra attentative, but could not do anything once they left the store. We would follow the perp and ask if she needed help when she was shopping and when she was trying clothes on. We had to remember every article or clothing or jewelry she had, so we could ask her how it looked. If she knew we knew what she had, she was less likely to steal. After she left, we would watch where she went next and notify the next store.</p>
								<p>In business, you do everything you can to not get screwed. You follow up by email and phone call and send invoices. Worst case, lawyer get involved and contracts get better. At some point you will get screwed over by a client, but it is due diligance to warn others from working with the client.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>How to get along with people</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>When the customer came in, your focus was them even if you had four other customers in other fitting rooms. They ask you for help. You help. If they want to tell you about their son or job, you listen. It helps gain the trust of the customer.</p>
								<p>Another good resource is <em>How to Win Friends and Influence People</em></p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Network</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I networked with customers all the time. I would do everyting I could to help the customer, and then find out what they did for a living.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Your coworkers don't have to be your best friends</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I enjoyed working with the men and women at Loft, but my goal wasn't to make friends. If you do form long lasting relationships, then that is a perk, but not a requirement.</p>
							</aside>
						</section>
						<!-- <section>
							<h2>Build confidence</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
							<p>I knew when I was doing a good job in retail, and was helping a customer. It built up my confidence that I could help others and have independence.</p>
							</aside>
						</section> -->
						<section>
							<h2>Talk to anyone &amp; everyone</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
								<p>I would talk to the tallest or the meanest looking woman, and try to help her find clothes or accessories to wear.</p>
								<p>This skill proved useful when I had to talk to Colonels, Major Generals, or CEOs when I was a contractor for the U.S. Army. I will talk to anyone.</p>

							<h2>Be introspective in school, and don't stop</h2>
							<aside class="notes">
							<p>When I started school I was a Bio major, then an architecture major, and then finally I admitted to myself and my parents, I was an artist with an interest in business. So I became a Graphic Designer. That realization took two years too long, but it was sooner than some. If you want to avoid that quarter life crisis, start focusing now.</p>
