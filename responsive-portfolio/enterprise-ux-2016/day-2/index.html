<h2>Theme 3: Designing Design Systems, Jack Moffett</h2>

<h3>Design Systems: From Project Done to Project Done to Product Sustained, eightshapes, Nathan Curtis</h3>

<ul>
<li>Beyond the Toolkit</li>
<li>Day 1: All handles design leadership meeting: IBM</li>
<li>google system:

<ul>
<li>material design arc, diverse products that are cohesive visually, echoes of design decisions in ux, search, use of color blue and iconography</li>
<li>google docs, play, mail, calendar, chrome, you can see divergencies, New button, color, pair color with icon and text, produce unique identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A design language big 3: Typography, color, iconography

<ul>
<li>Use same design system with different choices. visual style isn't just enough to make unification</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prioritize design system to make it a self sustaining enterprise

<ul>
<li>Design spec, Code library</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design system's reach

<ul>
<li>World's platform</li>
<li>An Enterprise's language</li>
<li>A portfolio's guide</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cisco, web marketing site: start with product section for selling, then support, training, about us

<ul>
<li>What's your get? Support. when people buy products, they are talking to sales</li>
<li>home page, avoid distractions, unstable patterns, get out of there. inject design system to all of them, start with navigation bar</li>
<li>Radiate influence Marriott from web apps, experiences shared with native apps and to websites, Marriott: reservation path</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sun Microsystems: component library

<ul>
<li>Andrew maintained it and had to wait</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Need to provide a tool and platform to help devs</li>
<li>Leah Buley</li>
<li>Federate influence that the people driving system to engage contributions and</li>
<li>Salesforce: cyclical team model, backlog and roadmap, shorter term pairings with orgs doing design, bringing influence in</li>
<li>sliding scale of giving a F, reveal passion for product to do and solve problems you need address</li>
<li>UVI: User experience, visual, interaction design

<ul>
<li>Need content in system and call it civx instead, designate go tos</li>
<li>mix doers with delegators.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Have a CEO who cares about design</li>
</ul>


<h3>Full-stack user experience: a marriage of design and technology, Dawn Ressel, Intuit</h3>

<ul>
<li>Surprising perspectives</li>
<li>Evolution of design systems:

<ul>
<li>Pattern libraries: doc of design, not a true design system</li>
<li>Component libraries: front end code, GE talk</li>
<li>Widget libraries: full stack code, functional on it's own and integrate</li>
<img src="../img/widget-benefits.jpg" alt="widget libraries">
<li>Past, present, future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A true design system must have a single source of truth in code

<ul>
<li>In the enterprise, how quickly and easily your design system can scale is directly proportional to the impact it can have</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intuit moved to cloud and made product more powerful, had a lot of data that could be connected wit independent products</li>
<li>One Intuit identity

<ul>
<li>Mint, quickbooks, turbotax</li>
<li>Interfaces were uneven quality and not sharing learnings and not unified</li>
<li>wanted to create a familiar experience across products</li>
<li>single identity, import mint user to make tax prep easier</li>
<li>Same account with additional product and show which products you've used in the past</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Success story

<ul>
<li>Account recovery: dramatically increased user success rates: increase 10%</li>
<li>Quickbooks: were concerned about changing patterns with changing old way, AB test 13% increase success. 50% reduction support calls, $560,000 cost reduction</li>
<li>Roadblock: hacks on tax identity. Engineers had widget and were worried additional security would become a barrier. They needed to add them. Rolled out additional security in one week. massive reduction in fraud in 1 week</li>
<li>That team partnered with IRS to battle tax fraud, using code in open source fashion</li>
<li>on intuit dev widgets are being used to improved productivity and decrease time to market are being used in 100% of products</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All products are financial management: upload data with doc, or take photo, experience should be the same whether work on budget or taxes

<ul>
<li>intuit link - used widgets</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if can be reused, make it a widget, only use it when it makes sense</li>
<li>It is 1.5 times more investment to build something in a way that is reusable</li>
<li>Widget and component libraries are shared</li>
<li>How do I do it?

<ul>
<li>Close partnership with technologist, cross disciplinary team (work with engineers)</li>
<li>get them excited, frame it around user, not my design</li>
<li>don't start with how, start with problem space, let them decide how to build it</li>
<li>give them a tough challenge</li>
<li>get them to feel the customer pain</li>
<li>listen tot hem and have empathy, find their motivation</li>
<li>be specific and accurate to build credibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How to handle resistance: overcoming barriers to working across teams

<ul>
<li>alignment can be slow</li>
<li>should this task work the same accountant and tax payer</li>
<li>start with single team with need and go really deep and look broadly across enterprise and embed with team, our designer as their designing. do research together. research bring people together</li>
<li>AB tests</li>
<li>paint a long term vision and what they can get in future</li>
<li>our medium is code for a user to benefit from</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>lightning: changing ui design called lightning, revamp design system and ui</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good year for the design system: got attention

<ul>
<li>about people and relationships helped the success for Lightning, was not top down, off grid in corner</li>
<li>Hustle for buy in from executive, more scrappier than that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Theme 1: Solving Problems

<li>salesforce mobile app with style guide for sales persons on the go</li>
<li>Customer and Partner's Needs: Customizations: Dreamforce hear from customer and partners</li>
<li>someone buy product, make it look like ours make it look like salesforce, changing css</li>
<li>Acquire a lot of code by acquisition, provide consistency across our products

<ul>
<li>Engineers don't like css</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implement removed gap between what designers want and developers deliver</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trust in design principles: clarity, efficiency, consistency, beauty

<ul>
<li>Create trust by showing not telling, living components were a conversation starter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sharing, brownbags, document, feedback surveys

<ul>
<li>trailhead, learning tool for free about salesforce</li>
<li>Open source to give back to community, we were putting ourselves on the map of representing salesforce</li>
<li>great at sharing and marketing outreach. two way part of feedback and push back and challenge when it wasn't working out. immediately responded in clarity of design system, external and internal. respond w/o ego</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Helped put UX at the seat at the table in the room</li>
</ul>


<h3>QA</h3>

<ul>
<li>Non adopters to design system are the haters and more interested in power in the org and not efficient way to do things for customers and users

<ul>
<li>show benefit to them over and over again, haters get marginalized when others like it, topple</li>
<li>design systems emerge from development, stop repeating ourselves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>legacy technology: re-architect tech to use design system, investment in future. our leaders need to understand it will pay dividends in the future</li>
<li>how do you get people to know things exist? publish in portal so people find and document</li>
</ul>
