<h2>Keynote: Everything is about to change: software as material, Greg Petroff</h2>

<ul>
<li>Architect originally</li>
<li>Business is waking up to the value of UX and design and its importance</li>
<li>Harvard Business Review: The evolution of design thinking</li>
<li>Design management value index, design companies outperform their peers in the marketplace</li>
<li>IXDA: Interaction Design Association</li>
<li><p>Risk</p>

<ul>
<li>Five emergent thing:

<ul>
<li>machine learning

<ul>
<li>Google go beat a grand master chess player and learned to play like a human. systems are learning</li>
<li>amazon echo--building knowledge graph at a fast pace</li>
<li>our jobs may become automated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IOT: Internet of Things

<ul>
<li>IP address for machines and cloud computing and handle massive volumes of info.</li>
<li>systems that can tell you their past, present, and future, with analytics you can predict future behavior based on scenario analysis: market, weather patterns, conditions, real time analysis</li>
<li>50 Billion devices w/ a URL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Security

<ul>
<li>Most issues are human error, answering emails and adding usbs to devices</li>
<li>Measure risk of placing data into environment</li>
<li>Embed into experiences</li>
<li>More data we share, the more our lives are transparent</li>
<li>Work to protect people's identity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Edge compute

<ul>
<li>Compute is basically free, Edison chip the size of sd card</li>
<li>Machines more intelligent and capable of using iot and cloud connectivity</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Block chain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Disruptive platforms</p>

<ul>
<li>Like uber, disrupting taxi service</li>
<li>new tech stack

<ul>
<li>build software differently</li>
<li>engineers struggle</li>
<li>Value proposition change, if you don't do it, someone will</li>
<li>Spin up software as a service quickly because of AWS and forking other applications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Iterate your way into a good outcome</li>
<li>end of product requirement document

<ul>
<li>Chunking software into smaller chunks, so much easier and unleashes productivity in a positive way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Systems of Inversion

<ul>
<li>systems of record

<ul>
<li>End up of having too many applications</li>
<li>Helped manage workforce</li>
<li>20 year old idea</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>systems of engagement

<ul>
<li>social graph to connect people and their needs

<ul>
<li>slack, Facebook, twitter, salesforce</li>
<li>helps understand how people work</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>systems of assets

<ul>
<li>doesn't matter if it's a thing or person, using tech platform, ought to be able to assemble everything you need in a moment</li>
<li>asset centric construct - requires a slew of conditions not available 5 years ago, but are now</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Context first

<ul>
<li>understand what you're doing, and i will deliver the right experience to allow you to be successful</li>
<li>algorithms push you to connect with those you normally connect with</li>
<li>New York times: choose your news based on context</li>
<li>Behavior model

<ul>
<li>understand how humans behave in systems is important</li>
<li>Smart rooms, adjust light and temperature, self aware experiences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now what?

<ul>
<li>No one understands the new ingredients

<ul>
<li>New capabilities are too broad and no one has experience, provide ambiguity for organizations</li>
<li>business has pressure with less productivity gains and need to transform</li>
<li>smarter companies are adopting technologies and being smart in deploying them</li>
<li>problem because of prediction frameworks:

<ul>
<li>what we do next is based on past experience but it doesn't work anymore</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>going to be easy to write software in the future with platform as a service space

<ul>
<li><strong>there will not be barriers, people can't say you can't do that</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What to build and why?

<ul>
<li>we are good at what if</li>
<li>we will learn how to build software in this modality to building</li>
<li>Design is a core to strategy

<ul>
<li>research matters and context is key</li>
<li>cannot shove software out the door and hope to be successful</li>
<li>Adductive: what if thinking: we are the idea generators</li>
<li>ambiguity can be your friend. do better things when things are fuzzy</li>
<li>we understand humans and what if we teach the machines how to feel</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We get to become the innovator and leader and we need to make sure it is design led with an experience connected to it</li>
<li>Need to harness creativity</li>
<li>Read and follow:

<ul>
<li>Jeremy Howard</li>
<li>MIT Technology review magazine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Designers need to learn to speak business over code</li>
<li>Look to shared economy because that is where business are testing ideas</li>
<li>look to subscription based models</li>
<li>UX learns how to write into the backlog for acceptance criteria

<ul>
<li>Has reqs, but make it smaller, rough outline. need to know the first thing to do and do it and make it great. can manage change and even if you write a detailed req, you may not know until you dig</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In smaller pieces and can forget the path</li>
</ul>


<h2>Theme1: How to succeed when everyone is your user, Ted Booth</h2>

<ul>
<li>Ted Booth, honeywell</li>
<li><p>Designers hate filling out your time card Sam</p>

<h3>Data exhaust and personal data: learning from consumer products to enhance enterprise ux, Sam Ladner</h3></li>
<li><p>Microsoft experience and at amazon now</p></li>
<li>Book: Practical ethnography</li>
<li>You need to understand the enterprise as a work place. it is where people do a specific activity</li>
<li>Research people not tech
<img src="../img/perspective-meeting-schedule-outlook.jpg" alt="meeting schedule outlook perspective">
<ul>
<li>Insurance: Digitize effort chained people to desk and not talking to their colleagues, quick pop to colleague (by the ways and social connectivity)</li>
<li>No social aspect and didn't see work flows</li>
<li>Now we talk about collaboration and experience, but we weren't doing that anymore, and didn't realize how productive it was before</li>
<li>Built the tools but didn't understand the people</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In whose interests?

<ul>
<li>workers resist things they don't like, they won't use it</li>
<li>Culture eats strategy for breakfast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Technostress: adapt to using computers and devices mobile apps</li>
<li>Talks about <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_74.htm">Theory X and Y</a> of management</li>
<li>Enterprise app dev aimed at customers, buyer not the user</li>
<li>That moment when user adopts a new tool</li>
<li>Can help people adopt the technology to help them and not over use</li>
<li>Data exhaust:  information exhaust

<ul>
<li>Waste product: capture natural gas to become fuel</li>
<li>All interactions you make with tools, leaves data trail</li>
<li>Customer: call center answer questions: get insight to customer

<ul>
<li>What value is the data exhaust to them</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Users get value from personal data, not big data

<ul>
<li>Fitbit, personal you may not want to share</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>First example newspaper customers is ad, readers are users. now Facebook

<ul>
<li>Now you can find out about people are doing in your network</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Delve for outlook

<ul>
<li>16 hours of meeting, email hours, focus hours, after hours: customer focus not user</li>
<li>plant improves your focus, going on hike, standing at your desk improves focus 45%</li>
<li>we should tell people that. build not for control of users</li>
<li>no longer chained to desk. help them make intuitive fields of logic  in power plant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>A First time, every time: making enterprise life better through continuous on boarding, Fredrik Matheson</h3>

<ul>
<li>Parkinson's law: middle age and energy. automation

<ul>
<li>don't want help. you want subordinate. do same work with multiple</li>
<li>Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>locked into being a first time user, no training available</li>
<li>Tesler's law of on the conservation of complexity

<ul>
<li>Fitness for task, done in right way</li>
<li>One cannot reduce the complexity of a task</li>
<li>One can only shift the burden</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tool: capture speed and traffic in Norway

<ul>
<li>need training first and then you're good</li>
<li>ease and power. do you want it to be easy or powerful. you have to master the tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Norway gov: (altinn) Everything is same, but application cleaner and see who has rights to app. add or remove

<ul>
<li>not an expert user for there are consequence if doesn't fill out form correctly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Made taxes easier since they have info on employer. taxes are done automatically</li>
<li>Simplifying dry information. if we don't do it, then customers and end users end up with same systems all over the place</li>
<li>what platform do you pick and what technology stack? Have ux involved in that instead of someone else picking</li>
<li>users are not interested in learning new things</li>
<li>Value proposition theory</li>
</ul>

</ul>


<h3>People + Places + Practices = Outcomes, Adam Cutler, Distinguished Designer, Design Practices Director, IBM</h3>

<ul>
<li>Everything stems from our culture

<ul>
<li>behavior/time = culture</li>
<li>how you choose to behave over the course of time becomes your culture

<ul>
<li>Values</li>
<li>Rituals</li>
<li>Heroes: Paul Rand, Doug Powell</li>
<li>symbols: post its, atomic units of thought</li>
<li>practices: practical application</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3 elements needed to create a sustainable culture of design at scale

<ul>
<li>has to endure after we are gone</li>
<li>people, places and practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>People

<ul>
<li>Collaborative egoless designer hiring 1500 designers</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>everything on studio is on wheels or can be moved by 2 people</li>
<li>Designed as a way for whole teams to work together</li>
<li>Space is not just for designers, but also a home for them</li>
<li>after 3 mo, they report to lines of business and structure based on what they need</li>
<li>remind the legacy of design and future</li>
<li>7th floor fluid spaces</li>
<li>rest of the space not designed for huddle or work space. Make livable space</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Practices

<ul>
<li>IBM Design Thinking</li>
<li>A focus on user outcomes</li>
<li>Multidisciplinary teams: different thought</li>
<li>Restless reinvention</li>
<li>the loop

</ul>
</li>
<li>The Keys align us

<ul>
<li>Hills: statement of intent for user</li>
<li>Playbacks: safe spaces for people to perform critiques</li>
<li>sponsor users: difficult to get core of users to test, program contracts set up or prospective clients or current clients to work 10-50 hours to co design with us</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>System of unity not uniformity at IBM</li>
<li>Individual teams create own design guide based on main guide</li>
<li>cohesive company with cohesive offerings</li>
<li>Everyone has a role as part of research</li>
<li>Outcomes

<ul>
<li>None of this matters w/o outcomes, something that ships</li>
<li>making user's life better</li>
<li>not for the sake of designing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
